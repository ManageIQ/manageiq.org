        ## Control your cloud

        Drive your complete virtual infrastructure with ManageIQ. Manage
        the lifecycle of your applications, place virtual workloads
        according to your business priorities, and &mdash; automatically
        through policies you set &mdash; balance your costs,
        performance, security, and reliability across cloud platforms.

        ManageIQ lets you control everything, completely, from one end
        of a virtual machine lifecycle to the other.
