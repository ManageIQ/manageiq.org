On behalf of the ManageIQ team, we're pleased to announce the Beta release for ManageIQ Euwe! 

Euwe is the next milestone release for ManageIQ cloud and virtualization management platform. The update is packed with new features and improvements. Highlights include:

* Centralized administration allowing you to invoke power and retirement operations on remote regions.
* Huge performance improvements for page rendering in the User Interface as well as SmartState for Microsoft Azure.
* Provider logic which asks instead of assuming that an operation or feature is available for a specific provider. In other words, known features are discoverable.
* High Availabilty for the PostgreSQL ManageIQ server maintaining a list of standby servers as well as a failover monitor for the database.
* New method taggable? to programmatically determine if a Service Model class or instance is taggable.
* Enhanced messaging for provisioning: Displayed elements.
