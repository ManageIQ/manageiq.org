          ### Step 1: **Download & deploy your appliance**

        - case deploy_type

          - when 'ovirt'
            :markdown
              1.  [Download ManageIQ for oVirt](http://manageiq.org/downloads/ManageIQ-stable-ovirt.ova){: .download-link}
                  to your local computer.

              2.  When the file has finished downloading, upload it to
                  an export domain on your oVirt instance by running the
                  following command locally:

                  ~~~bash
                  engine-image-uploader -e $YOUR_EXPORT_DOMAIN --engine=$YOUR_ENGINE_HOST upload -v -m ManageIQ-stable-ovirt.ova
                  ~~~

              3.  Navigate to the "Template Import" tab of your export
                  domain in your oVirt admin console, and import the
                  ManageIQ image template you uploaded.

              4.  Create a new virtual machine from the ManageIQ
                  template, and start the VM.


          - when 'rhev'
            :markdown
              1.  [Download ManageIQ for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization](http://manageiq.org/downloads/ManageIQ-stable-ovirt.ova){: .download-link}
                  to your local computer.

              2.  When the file has finished downloading, upload it to an
                  export domain on your RHEV instance by running the
                  following command locally:

                  ~~~bash
                  rhevm-image-uploader -e $YOUR_EXPORT_DOMAIN --engine=$YOUR_RHEVM_HOST upload -v -m ManageIQ-stable-ovirt.ova
                  ~~~

              3.  Navigate to the "Template Import" tab of your export
                  domain in your RHEV-M console, and import the
                  ManageIQ image template you uploaded.

              4.  Create a new virtual machine from the ManageIQ
                  template, and start the VM.


          - when 'openstack'
            :markdown
              1.  Download ManageIQ directly to OpenStack by running
                  this command:

                  ~~~bash
                  curl -O http://manageiq.org/downloads/ManageIQ-stable-openstack.qc2 && \
                  glance image-create --name "ManageIQ-stable" \
                  --is-public True --disk-format qcow2 \
                  --container-format=bare --file ManageIQ-stable-openstack.qc2
                  ~~~

              2.  Launch a new instance from the ManageIQ image. ManageIQ needs a
                  minimum of 6GB RAM and a 45GB persistent disk, so choose or create
                  an instance flavor accordingly.

          - when 'vmware'
            :markdown
              1.  From the vSphere client, click File → Deploy OVF Template
                  (or Actions → Deploy OVF Template from the vSphere Web client).

              2.  Enter `http://manageiq.org/downloads/ManageIQ-stable-vsphere.ova`
                  in the URL field of the resulting dialog window, and select
                  the location, host and storage you wish to use for the ManageIQ VM.

              3.  Check the box "Power on after deployment" to start the VM
                  once the deployment is complete.


        :markdown
          ### Step 2: **First connection and configuration**

          1.  Log into the ManageIQ dashboard by connecting to the new running VM
              with a web browser, or access the console of your virtual machine.
              The initial username and password is `admin`/`smartvm`.

          2.  There are a number of basic settings, located under
              "Configure → Configuration" in the web interface, or under
              "Advanced setting" in the VM console, that you may wish to
              change when starting ManageIQ for the first time. Among the
              most common are:

              * Time and date settings
              * DHCP configuration
              * Hostname
              * Admin password


          ### Step 3: **Add an infrastructure or cloud provider**

          Now that your ManageIQ Appliance is up and running, it's time to connect up
          with your Providers (Cloud or Infrastructure) and gather data about them.

          To discover a new infrastructure provider (Microsoft SCVMM, RHEV,
          oVirt, or vSphere), navigate to Infrastructure → Providers. Click
          Configuration → Discover, select the type and enter an IP Range.
          To add a new cloud provider (OpenStack, Amazon EC2), navigate
          to Clouds → Providers. Click Configuration → Discover, select the type and
          enter an IP Range.

          



          ## What's next?

          ### Consult the docs

          * The [quickstart guide](/documentation/quickstart) contains more
          detailed information on configuring providers,and on provisioning
          virtual machines and cloud instances.
          * Much of the information in the downstream
          [Cloudforms 3.0 docs](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/CloudForms/)
          applies to ManageIQ.
