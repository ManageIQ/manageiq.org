## Providers

A provider is a server with software to manage multiple virtual machines that reside on multiple hosts. The **Providers** page, found under the Infrastructure tab, displays all discovered or added providers in your enterprise.

**Note**
Any applied filters will be in effect on this page.
{: .notice-note}

Use the **Providers** taskbar to manage the existence of your providers and to initiate a refresh of them. These buttons are used to manage multiple providers at one time. To manage one provider, click on that item in the main area of the screen.

The ManageIQ Console uses virtual thumbnails to describe providers. Each thumbnail contains four quadrants by default. This allows a user to glance at a provider for a quick view of its number of hosts and authentication status.

|![](doc/getting-started/2191.png)|Invalid: Authentication credentials are invalid.|
|![](doc/getting-started/2192.png)|Unknown: Authentication status is unknown or no credentials have been entered.|


### Discovering Providers

After initial creation of a ManageIQ environment, discover the providers in your environment. To do this, use ManageIQ's ability to discover using a range of IP addresses.

**Procedure 5.1. To Discover Providers by Subnet Range**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Providers**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click ![](doc/getting-started/2119.png) **(Discover Infrastructure Providers)**.
3.  Check the type of provider to discover.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2195.png)

4.  Type in a **Subnet Range** of IP addresses staring with a **From Address** and ending with a **To Address**. The cursor automatically advances as you complete each octet.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2196.png)

5.  Click **Start** to confirm the discovery process.

Result:

The server searches for computers running supported providers. When available, the new providers display. These providers are named using a Hostname and IP address. To make them identifiable, edit the basic information for each provider.

### Adding a Provider

If you are not able to use ManageIQ's discovery process, you can add providers to the appliance with the following procedure.

**Procedure 5.2. To Add a Provider**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Providers**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) **(Add a New Infrastructure Provider)**.
3.  Type in the **Name** of the provider to add. The **Name** is how the device is labeled in the console.
4.  Select the **Type** of provider: **Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager** or **VMware vCenter**.
5.  Type in the **Host Name**, and **IP Address** of the provider to add.
6.  For Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization providers, enter the **API Port** if your provider uses a non-standard port for access.
7.  If you have multiple zones, select the appropriate one from **Zone**.
8.  Type in a **User ID** and **Password** with administrator privileges to the provider. To refresh a provider, these credentials are required.
9.  Click **Validate** to confirm that the user and password connects.
10. Click **Save**.

Result:

ManageIQ adds a new provider. Use this provider for virtual machine provisioning.

**Note**
To obtain historical Capacity and Utilization (C & U) data for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager, you will need to add credentials for the Red Hat C & U Database. Once discovered, and set up for C & U in ManageIQ, you can use ManageIQ to collect C & U from this point forward. For further information, refer to *Chapter 4. Data Collection Setup and Reports Installation* in the *Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.1 Installation Guide*.

### Requirements for Provisioning a Host

ManageIQ can provision hosts using PXE and Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) technologies. To do this, complete the following steps before you provision your first host.

**Procedure 5.5. To Provision a Host**

1.  Make a PXE server accessible to the ManageIQ server.
2.  Create a customization template for hosts. This customization template must contain host-specific additions, documented in the *Customization Templates for Host Provisioning* section.
3.  Create system image types for the host.
4.  Associate images with the image types.
5.  Enable IPMI on provisioning hosts and add them to the ManageIQ Infrastructure.


#### PXE Provisioning

PXE is a boot method that allows you to load files from across a network link. ManageIQ uses it for files required for provisioning virtual machines. PXE can be used for provisioning for either Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager or VMware.

-   Connect to the **PXE Server**.
-   Create a **System Image Type**.
-   Associate each **PXE** image with an image type.
-   Create a customization template.


##### Connecting to a PXE Server

The following procedure connects to a PXE server and adds its details to ManageIQ.

**Procedure 5.6. To connect to a PXE server**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **PXE**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) (**Add a New PXE Server**).
3.  In **Basic Information**, type a **Name** that will be meaningful in your environment.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2316.png)

4.  For **Depot Type**, select either **Network File System** (NFS) or **Samba**. The fields to enter in the dialog depend on the **Depot Type**.
    -   For NFS, type in the **URI**, **Access URL**, **PXE Directory**, **Windows Images Directory** and **Customization Directory**. When you provision, ManageIQ writes a text file to the **PXE Directory**. The file is named after the MAC address of the NIC that is assigned to the virtual machine. It contains where to get the kernel and initrd image. This file is removed after a successful provision. The **Windows Images Directory** is where the files are located on your NFS for the provisioning of Windows operating systems. The **Customization Directory** is where your Kickstart and Sysprep files are located.
    -   If using a **Depot Type** of **Samba**, you will not need **Access URL**, but you will need a **User ID**, and **Password**, in addition to the items required for NFS.

5.  For **PXE Image Menus**, type the **filename** for the PXE Boot menu.
6.  Click **Add**.
7.  Select the new PXE server from the tree on the left, and click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) (**Configuration**), then ![](doc/getting-started/2003.png) (**Refresh**) to see your existing images.

Result:

The PXE server is added to the ManageIQ database.

**Note**
Next, create PXE Image types to associate with the customization templates and to specify if the image type is for a virtual machine, a host, or both.
{: .notice-note}


##### Creating System Image Types for PXE

The following procedure creates a system image type for PXE servers.

**Procedure 5.7. To create system image types**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **PXE**.
2.  Click the **System Image Types** accordion.

4.  In **Basic Information**, type in a **Name** and select a **Type**.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2317.png)

    -   Use **Host** if you want this image type to only apply to hosts.
    -   Use **Vm** if you want this image type to only apply to virtual machines.
    -   Use **Any** if this image type can be used for either hosts or virtual machines.

5.  Click **Add**.

Result:

System image types are added.

**Note**
After creating the System Image Types, assign the types to each image on your PXE servers. To do this, you will select each image on the PXE server and identify its type.
{: .notice-note}


##### Setting the PXE Image Type for a PXE Image

The following procedure sets the image type for a chosen PXE image.

    -   Check **Stateless** if you do not want the files deleted after the provision completes. A stateless provision does not write to the disk so it will need the PXE files on the next boot.

9.  Click **Submit**.

Result:

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the admin, approver, or super admin account role must approve the request. The admin and super admin roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requestor or the approver.


## Virtual Machines

The heterogeneous virtual machine container and guest support combined with the ability to analyze information inside the virtual machine - such as disk space, patch level or installed applications - provides in-depth information across the virtual environment. This rich set of information enables ManageIQ users to improve problem resolution times and effectively manage virtual machines.

The **Virtual Machines** pages display all virtual machines that were discovered by your Server. Note that if you have applied a filter to a user, it will be in effect here. The **Virtual Machines** taskbar is a menu driven set of buttons that provide access to functions related to virtual machines.

The **Virtual Machines** page has three accordions organizing your virtual machines and templates in different ways. All of these accordions share a set of common controls

-   Use **VMs and Templates** to view your virtual machines and templates organized by Provider. In addition, you can see archived and orphaned items here.
-   Use the **VMs** to view, apply filters, and collect information about all of your virtual machines.
-   Use **Templates** to view, apply filters, and collect information about all of your templates.

Through the console, you are able to view your virtual machines in multiple ways. For your virtual machines, you can:

-   Filter virtual machines
-   Change views
-   Sort
-   Create a report
-   Search by MyTags
-   Search by collected data


### Provisioning

When a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through multiple phases. First, the request must be made. The request includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization of the request. Second, the request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual. Finally, the request is executed. This part of provisioning consists of pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses for the user, creates CMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine or instance based on information in the request. Post-processing activates the CMDB instance and emails the user. The steps for provisioning may be modified at any time using ManageIQ.

2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2007.png) **(Lifecycle)**, and then ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) **(Provision)**.
3.  Select a template from the list presented.
4.  Click **Continue**.
5.  On the **Request** tab, enter information about this provisioning request.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2326.png)

    In **Request Information**, type in at least a **First Name** and **Last Name** and an email address. This email is used to send the requester status emails during the provisioning process for items such as auto-approval, quota, provision complete, retirement, request pending approval, and request denied. The other information is optional. If the ManageIQ server is configured to use LDAP, you can use the **Look Up** button to populate the other fields based on the email address.

    **Note**
    Parameters with a \* next to the label are required to submit the provisioning request. To change the required parameters, see *Customizing Provisioning Dialogs*.
    {: .notice-note}

6.  Click the **Purpose** tab to select the appropriate tags for the provisioned virtual machines.
7.  Click the **Catalog** tab to select the template to provision from. This tab is context sensitive based on provider.
8.  For templates on VMware providers:
    1.  For **Provision Type**, select **NetApp**, **VMware**, or **PXE**.

        ![](doc/getting-started/2328.png)

        1.  If **VMware** is selected, check **Linked Clone** if you want to create a linked clone to the virtual machine instead of a full clone. Since a snapshot is required to create a linked clone, this box is only enabled if a snapshot is present. Select the snapshot you want to use for the linked clone.
        2.  If **PXE** is selected, select a PXE **Server** and **Image** to use for provisioning

    2.  Under **Count**, select the number of virtual machines you want to create in this request.
    3.  Use **VM Naming** to specify a virtual machine name and virtual machine description. When provisioning multiple virtual machines, a number will be appended to the virtual machine name.

9.  For templates on Red Hat providers:
    1.  Select the **Name** of a template to use.
    2.  For **Provision Type**, select either **ISO**, **PXE**, or **Native Clone**.
        1.  If **Native Clone** is selected, check **Linked Clone** if you want to create a linked clone to the virtual machine instead of a full clone. This is equivalent to *Thin Template Provisioning* in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation. Since a snapshot is required to create a linked clone, this box is only enabled if a snapshot is present. Select the snapshot you want to use for the linked clone.
        2.  If **ISO** is selected, select an ISO **Image** to use for provisioning
        3.  If **PXE** is selected, select a PXE **Server** and **Image** to use for provisioning

    3.  Under **Count**, select the number of virtual machines you want to create in this request.
    4.  Use **VM Naming** to specify a **VM Name** and **VM Description**. When provisioning multiple virtual machines, a number will be appended to the **VM Name**.

10. Click the **Environment** tab to decide where you want the new virtual machines to reside.
    1.  If provisioning from a template on VMware, you can either let ManageIQ decide for you by checking **Choose Automatically**, or select a specific cluster, resource pool, folder, host, and datastore.
    2.  If provisioning from a template on Red Hat, you can either let ManageIQ decide for you by checking **Choose Automatically**, or select a datacenter, cluster, host and datastore.

11. Click the **Hardware** tab to set hardware options.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2330.png)

    1.  In **VM Hardware**, set the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and disk format: thin, pre-allocated/thick or same as the provisioning template (default).
    2.  For VMware provisioning, set the **VM Limits** of CPU and memory the virtual machine can use.
    3.  For VMware provisioning, set the In **VM Reservation** amount of CPU and memory.

12. Click **Network** to set the vLan adapter. Additional networking settings that are internal to the operating system appear on the Customize tab.

    ![](doc/getting-started/2335.png)

    1.  In **Network Adapter Information**, select the **vLan**.

13. Click **Customize** to select how you might want to customize the operating system of the new virtual machine. These options vary based on the *operating system* of the template.
14. For Windows provisioning:

    ![](doc/getting-started/2336.png)

    1.  To use a customer specification from the Provider, click **Specification**. To select an appropriate template, a list will be provided in the custom specification area. The values that are honored by ManageIQ will display.

        **Note**
        Any values in the specification that do not show in the ManageIQ console's request dialogs will not be used by ManageIQ. For example, for Windows operating systems, if you have any run once values in the specification, they will not be used in creating the new virtual machines. Currently, for a Windows operating system, ManageIQ honors the unattended GUI, identification, workgroup information, user data, windows options, and server license. If more than one network card is specified, only the first will be used.
        {: .notice-note}

        ![](doc/getting-started/2337.png)

        To modify the specification, check **Override Specification Values**.

    2.  Select **Sysprep Answer File**, to upload a Sysprep file or use one that exists for a custom specification on the Provider where the template resides. To upload a file, click **Browse** to find the file, and then upload. To use an answer file in **Customization Specification**, simply click on the item. The answer file will automatically upload for viewing. You cannot make modifications to it.

15. For Linux provisioning:
    1.  Under **Credentials**, enter a **Root Password** for the `root`{: .literal} user to access the instance.
    2.  Enter a **IP Address Information** for the instance. Leave as **DHCP** for automatic IP assignment from the provider.
    3.  Enter any **DNS** information for the instance if necessary.
    4.  Select a **Customize Template** for additional instance configuration. Select from the Kickstart scripts stored on your appliance.

16. Click the **Schedule** tab to decide if you want the provisioning to begin as soon as it is approved, or at a specific time.
    1.  In **Schedule Info**, choose if you want the provisioning to begin as soon as it is approved, or at a specific time. If you select **Schedule**, you will be prompted to enter a date and time.
    2.  In **Lifespan**, select if you want to power on the virtual machines after they are created, and if you want to set a retirement date. If you select a retirement period, you will be prompted for when you want a retirement warning.

        ![](doc/getting-started/2338.png)

17. Click **Submit**.

Result:

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the administrator, approver, or super administrator account role must approve the request. The administrator and super administrator roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requester or the approver.


#### Approving a Provisioning Request

After a user creates provisioning request, administrators have the ability to approve the request and allow ManageIQ to complete virtual machine or instance creation.

**Procedure 5.20. To approve a provisioning request**

1.  Navigate to **Services** → **Requests**.
2.  Click on the request you want to approve.
3.  Type in a **Reason** for the approval.
4.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1852.png) **(Approve this request)**.

Result:

The provision request is sent for completion.


### Controlling Virtual Machines

You can start, stop, and suspend a virtual machine through the ManageIQ console. To do this, the following requirements must be met:

-   The virtual machine must be discovered.
-   The virtual machine must be registered to a host and have a SmartProxy associated with it. It may not be on a repository.


#### Controlling the Power State of Virtual Machines

Start, stop, and suspend any number of virtual machines through the ManageIQ Console using the following procedure.

**Procedure 5.21. To control the power state of virtual machines**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Virtual Machines**.
2.  Check the virtual machines that you want to change the power state for.
3.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1998.png) (**Power Operations**). Note that the only operations that will be available are the ones that apply to the virtual machines' current power state.
4.  Click the button for the power operation you want.
    1.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1999.png) (**Power On**) to start the selected virtual machines.
    2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2000.png) (**Power Off**) to stop the selected virtual machines.
    3.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2004.png) (**Suspend**) to suspend the selected virtual machines.
    4.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2001.png) (**Reset**) to stop the selected virtual machines
    5.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2002.png) (**Shutdown Guest**) to stop the guest operating system.
    6.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2003.png) (**Restart Guest**) to restart the guest operating system.

5.  Click **OK** to confirm the choice you selected.

Result:

The requested action is initiated.


### Analyzing Virtual Machines and Templates

Analyze a virtual machine to collect metadata such as user accounts, applications, software patches, and other internal information. If ManageIQ is not set up for automatic analysis, perform a manual analysis of a virtual machine. To perform a SmartState analysis, ManageIQ requires a running SmartProxy with visibility to the virtual machine's storage location. If the virtual machine is associated with a host or provider, ensure the virtual machine is registered with that system to be properly analyzed; the server requires this information since a snapshot might be created.

**Note**
SmartState Analysis of a virtual machine requires access to its host. To perform a successful analysis, edit the virtual machine's host and enter the host's authentication credentials.
{: .notice-note}

**Procedure 5.22. To Analyze Multiple Virtual Machines Or Templates**

1.  Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Virtual Machines**.
2.  Click the accordion for the items to analyze.
3.  Check the **Virtual Machines** and **Templates** to analyze.
4.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, and then ![](doc/getting-started/2147.png) **(Perform SmartState Analysis)** on the taskbar.
5.  Click **OK** to confirm.

Result:

The SmartProxy returns the current data.


#### Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Prerequisites


##### SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1 - Storage Support Notes

Note the following requirements when performing a SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.1.

**NFS**

-   The ManageIQ Server requires a mount to the NFS Datastore.

**iSCSI / FCP**

-   Cluster must use full Red Hat Enterprise Linux (not Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor) Hosts.
-   CFME VM leverages the DirectLUN Disk to connect to each Storage Domain LUN.
-   A ManageIQ Appliance *must* reside in each Datacenter with the iSCSI / FCP storage type.
-   Each ManageIQ Appliance performing Smart State Analysis requires a *sharable*, *non-bootable* DirectLUN attached for each iSCSI/FCP storage domain. Only one DirectLUN for each storage domain may be mounted at a time.

**Other Notes**

-   **Set Server Relationship** - This is required to allow the VM SmartState Analysis job to determine what datacenter a ManageIQ Appliance is running in and therefore identify what storage it has access to in a RHEV environment.
    1.  After setting up a ManageIQ Appliance and performing a refresh of the Provider, find the ManageIQ Appliance in the **Virtual Machine** accordion list and view its summary screen.
    2.  Click **Configuration** → **Edit Server Relationship**.
    3.  Select the server that relates to this instance of the ManageIQ Appliance.

**Important**
If you attach a DirectLUN disk after configuring the ManageIQ Database, access the Appliance in a terminal and run `pvscan`{: .command} to detect the DirectLUN disk. Alternatively, you can restart the Appliance to detect the disk automatically.
{: .notice-important}


##### SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 - Storage Support Notes

There are two additional steps required to perform a SmartState Analysis on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 using iSCSI or FCP storage. NFS storage does not have these requirements.

1.  Enable DirectLUN support for the host and ManageIQ Appliance that performs the analysis.
    -   Enable DirectLUN on host.
    -   Enable DirectLUN on the ManageIQ Appliance. To do this, edit the desired Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization storage and get the LUNID value. Then, on the ManageIQ Appliance virtual machine in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization user interface, right-click and select **Edit**+**Custom Properties** and enter the following in the **Custom Properties** edit box:

        ```
        directlun=<LUN ID>:readonly
        ```

        If you have multiple storage domains separate them by a comma, similar to:

        ```
        directlun=<LUN ID 1>:readonly,<LUN ID 2>:readonly,<LUN ID N>:readonly
        ```

        **Note**

        The ManageIQ Appliance must reside in the same data center as the storage you are trying to connect. If you have multiple data centers with iSCSI or FCP storage, you need a ManageIQ Appliance in each data center to support virtual machine scanning.

2.  Set Server Relationship - This is required to allow the virtual machine SmartState analysis job to determine which data center a ManageIQ Appliance is running and therefore identify what storage it has access to in a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment.
    1.  After setting up a ManageIQ Appliance and performing a refresh of the Provider, find the ManageIQ Appliance in the **Virtual Machine** accordion list and view its summary screen.
    2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, and then ![](doc/getting-started/2146.png) **(Edit Server Relationship)**
    3.  Select the server that relates to this instance of the ManageIQ Appliance.


##### Upgrades from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 to 3.1

Environments upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 to 3.1 might encounter issues regarding SSL communications with ManageIQ. This issue occurs from version 3.1 due to Apache being used as a front end to handle the SSL requests. The upgrade to 3.1 does not reconfigure the Provider for this. [^[2]^](#ftn.idm50354888)

A change to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager configuration allows ManageIQ to use SSL to connect rather than the current TLS.

1.  Log into the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager server's terminal as the `root`{: .literal} user.
2.  Modify the `/usr/share/ovirt-engine/service/engine-service.xml.in`{: .filename} file.
3.  Scroll to `protocols`{: .literal} inside the `ssl`{.literal} tag. The current value of the protocols attribute is `TLSv1`{.literal}.

    ``` xml
    <ssl>
      <protocols>TLSv1</protocols>
    </ssl>
    ```

4.  Replace the value of the `protocols`{: .literal} attribute with `SSLv3,TLSv1`{.literal}.

    ``` xml
    <ssl>
      <protocols>SSLv3,TLSv1</protocols>
    </ssl>
    ```

5.  Save the file.
6.  Restart the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager server.

In addition, set the **Server Relationship** for ManageIQ.

1.  Select the ManageIQ Provider's virtual machine from **Services** → **Virtual Machines**.
2.  Go to **Configuration** → **Edit Server Relationship** and select the appropriate ManageIQ Server.


#### VMware vSphere Prerequisites


##### Installing VMware VDDK on ManageIQ

Execution of SmartState Analysis on virtual machines within a VMware environment requires the Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK). ManageIQ supports VDDK 5.5.

**Procedure 5.23. To install the VDDK on a ManageIQ Appliance**

1.  Download VDDK 5.5 (`VMware-vix-disklib-5.5.0-1284542.x86_64.tar.gz`{: .filename} at the time of this writing) from the VMware website.

    **Note**
    If you do not already have a login ID to VMware, then you will need to create one. At the time of this writing, the file can be found by navigating to **Downloads** → **All Downloads, Drivers & Tools** → **VMware vSphere** → **Drivers & Tools**. Expand **Automation Tools and SDKs**, and select **vSphere Virtual Disk Development Kit 5.5**. Alternatively, find the file by searching for it using the **Search** on the VMware site.

## Clouds

Cloud computing provides a set of pooled resources used to create a set of scalable virtual machine instances. Resources includes CPUs, memory, storage, and networking. While users of virtualization infrastructure environments provision whole virtual machines, users of cloud computing environments provision only the necessary resources to build their instances. This means the customer can easily scale their instances by provisioning more resources. Metric usage is focused on the hardware layer, and results in the user paying only the necessary resources.

For example, a user might use an instance to store a web server. During peak times of use, the user provisions more cloud resources to maintain the performance of the server. During quiet times, the user reduces the consumption of cloud resources. As a result, the user only uses and pays for the resources used.

ManageIQ offers a set of tools for viewing and maintaining cloud providers and their associated resources. Supported cloud providers include:

-   Amazon EC2 (public cloud)
-   OpenStack (private cloud)


### Adding a Cloud Provider

After initial installation and creation of a ManageIQ environment, add cloud providers with the following procedure.

**Procedure 6.1. To Add a Cloud Provider**

1.  Navigate to **Clouds** → **Providers**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) **(Add a New Cloud Provider)**.
3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.
4.  Select the **Type** of cloud provider.
    -   If selecting an **Amazon EC2**, select an **Amazon Region**.
    -   If selecting an OpenStack provider, use the **AMQP** subtab to provide credentials required for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol service on your OpenStack Nova component. Also enter the **API Port** of your Keystone service.

5.  Select the appropriate **Zone** if you have more than one available.
6.  Fill out the **Credentials** by typing in a **User ID**, **Password**, and a verification of this password (**Verify Password**).
    -   If selecting an **Amazon EC2**, generate an **Access Key** in the **Security Credentials** of your Amazon AWS account. The **Access Key ID** acts as your **User ID**, and your **Secret Access Key** acts as your **Password**.
    -   If selecting **OpenStack**, use the Keystone User ID and Password for your login credentials.

        **Important**

        To enable discovery of OpenStack cloud providers, ensure that the `iptables`{: .filename} for the OpenStack host providing Keystone services allows port 5000 access to all hosts on the same network.

7.  If editing an OpenStack provider, use the **AMQP** subtab to provide credentials required for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol service on your OpenStack Nova component.
8.  Click **Validate** to validate the credentials.
9.  Click **Add**.

Result:

ManageIQ adds a new cloud provider. Use this cloud provider for instance provisioning.


### Discovering Amazon EC2 Cloud Providers

ManageIQ provides the ability to discover cloud providers associated with a particular set of Amazon EC2 account details.

**Procedure 6.2. To Discover an Amazon Ec2 Cloud Provider**

1.  Navigate to **Clouds** → **Providers**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click ![](doc/getting-started/2119.png) **(Discover Cloud Providers)**.
3.  Enter your Amazon EC2 **User ID** and **Password**. Reenter your password in the **Verify Password** field.
4.  Click **Start**.

Result:

The Amazon EC2 providers discovery begins. ManageIQ adds all cloud providers associated with the chosen account.


### Editing a Cloud Provider

Edit information about a provider such as the name, IP address, and login credentials.

**Procedure 6.3. To Edit a Cloud Provider**

1.  Navigate to **Clouds** → **Providers**.
2.  Click the cloud provider to edit.
3.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, and then ![](doc/getting-started/1851.png) **(Edit Selected Cloud Provider)**.
4.  Edit the **Basic Information**. This varies depending on the **Type** of provider.

    **Note**
    The **Type** value is unchangeable. To use a different cloud provider, create a new one.
    {: .notice-note}

5.  Fill out the **Credentials** by typing in a **User ID**, **Password**, and a verification of this password (**Verify Password**).
    -   If selecting an **Amazon EC2**, generate an **Access Key** in the **Security Credentials** of your Amazon AWS account. The **Access Key ID** acts as your **User ID**, and your **Secret Access Key** acts as your **Password**.
    -   If selecting **OpenStack**, use the Keystone User ID and Password for your login credentials.

6.  If editing an OpenStack provider, use the **AMQP** subtab to provide credentials required for the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol service on your OpenStack Nova component.
7.  Click **Validate** and wait for notification of successful validation.
8.  Click **Save**.

Result:

ManageIQ saves the modified provider details.


### Refreshing Cloud Providers

Refresh a cloud provider to find other resources related to it. Ensure the chosen cloud providers have the correct credentials before refreshing.

**Procedure 6.4. To Refresh Cloud Providers**

1.  Navigate to **Clouds** → **Providers**.
2.  Select the checkboxes for the cloud providers to refresh.
3.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, and then ![](doc/getting-started/2003.png) **(Refresh Relationships and Power States)**.
4.  Click **OK** to confirm the refresh.

Result:

ManageIQ refreshes the details for the chosen cloud providers.


## Containers

The currently supported container provider types are:

- [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)
- [OpenShift Origin](http://www.openshift.org/)
- [OpenShift Enterprise](https://enterprise.openshift.com/)
- [Atomic](http://www.projectatomic.io/)
- [Atomic Enterprise](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-atomic-enterprise-platform)

### Service Accounts

To add a Kubernetes or OpenShift provider you must create, in those clusters, a specific `management` service account with the proper role,
permissions, and authentication token.

For more information on these topics, check out the relevant documentation:

- [Kubernetes Service Accounts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.1/docs/design/service_accounts.md)
- [Kubernetes Authentication](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.1/docs/admin/authentication.md)
- [OpenShift Service Accounts](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.0/dev_guide/service_accounts.html)

To add a `management` service account in an OpenShift cluster:

    $ oadm new-project management-infra --description="Management Infrastructure"

    $ oc create -n management-infra -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: management-admin
    EOF

    $ oc create -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ClusterRole
    metadata:
      name: management-infra-admin
    rules:
    - resources:
      - pods/proxy
      verbs:
      - '*'
    EOF

    $ oadm policy add-role-to-user -n management-infra admin -z management-admin
    $ oadm policy add-role-to-user -n management-infra management-infra-admin -z management-admin
    $ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-reader system:serviceaccount:management-infra:management-admin
    $ oadm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:management-infra:management-admin

*Note: at the moment the `management-infra-admin` role is needed to address the OpenShift issue [#5973](https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/5973).*

To obtain the `management` service account token name:

    oc get -n management-infra sa/management-admin --template='{{range .secrets}}{{printf "%s\n" .name}}{{end}}'
    management-admin-token-32f97
    management-admin-dockercfg-fvkso

To retrieve the token (substitute `management-admin-token-32f97` with the name of your token):

    $ oc get -n management-infra secrets management-admin-token-32f97 --template='{{.data.token}}' | base64 -d
    eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cC...

It is now possible to use the token to add the container provider in ManageIQ (see next chapter).


### Configuring OpenShift Metrics

To collect the `nodes`, `pods` and `containers` metrics it is required to run the OpenShift Metrics services inside your cluster.
For more infromation on this subject please refer to the [OpenShift Metrics Documentation](https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics).

**Note:** use the OpenShift master public hostname as the `HAWKULAR_METRICS_HOSTNAME`, at the moment a limitation in ManageIQ is assuming
that the provider *Host Name* is used also to collect the metrics.

Once [Hawkular Metrics](http://www.hawkular.org/) and [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster) have been successfully deployed
by OpenShift Metrics it is possible to create a router for ManageIQ to access the metrics data:

    oadm router management-metrics \
      --credentials=/etc/origin/master/openshift-router.kubeconfig \
      --service-account=router --ports='443:5000' \
      --selector='kubernetes.io/hostname=<INSERT MASTER HOSTNAME HERE>'
      --stats-port=1937 \
      --host-network=false

This router, at the moment, **must** run on the master nodes in order to expose the metrics on the port **5000** to ManageIQ, hence the
need for a `selector` on the `kubernetes.io/hostname` of the master node.

As long as the router, or routers, are accessible from the same public hostname of the master it is possible to use different selectors
and scale the number of replicas in order to achieve high availability.


### Adding a Container Provider

After initial installation and creation of a ManageIQ environment and the creation of the `management` service account in the relevant container cluster, you can add the provider:

**Procedure 6.1. To Add a Container Provider**

1.  Navigate to **Containers** → **Providers**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1847.png) **(Configuration)**, then click ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) **(Add a New Container Provider)**.
3.  Enter a **Name** for the provider.
4.  Select the **Type** of container provider.

## Provisioning Instances

Cloud instances follow the same process (Request, Approval, Deployment) as a standard virtual machine from virtualization infrastructure. First, a user makes a request for instances and specifies the image, tags, availability zone and hardware profile flavor. Second, the request goes through the approval phase. Finally, ManageIQ executes the request.


### Provisioning Instance


#### Provisioning an Instance from an Image

Users provision instances from images stored on their cloud provider. This procedure steps through the provisioning process.

**Procedure 6.5. To provision an instance from an image**

1.  Navigate to **Clouds** → **Instances**.
2.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/2007.png) (**Lifecycle**), then click ![](doc/getting-started/1848.png) **(Provision Instances)**.
3.  Select an image from the list presented.
4.  Click **Continue**.
5.  On the **Request** tab, enter information about this provisioning request. In **Request Information**, type in at least a first and last name and an email address. This email is used to send the requester status emails during the provisioning process for items such as auto-approval, quota, provision complete, retirement, request pending approval, and request denied. The other information is optional. If the ManageIQ Server is configured to use LDAP, you can use the **Look Up** button to populate the other fields based on the email address.

    **Note**
    Parameters with a \* next to the label are required to submit the provisioning request. To change the required parameters, see *Customizing Provisioning Dialogs*.

6.  Click the **Purpose** tab to select the appropriate tags for the provisioned instance.
7.  Click the **Catalog** tab for basic instance options.
    1.  To change the image to use as a basis for the instance, select it from the list of images.
    2.  Select the **Number of VMs** to provision.
    3.  Type a **VM Name** and **VM Description**.

8.  Click the **Environment** tab to select the instance's **Availability Zone**. If no specific availability zone is require, select the **Choose Automatically** checkbox.
9.  Click the **Hardware** tab to set provider options such as hardware flavor and security settings.
    1.  Select a flavor from the **Instance Type** list.
    2.  Select a **Guest Access Key Pair** for access to the instance.
    3.  In **Security Groups**, select which security group suits your allowed port and IP address requirements. Otherwise, leave at the default group.
    4.  If provisioning from an Amazon EC2 provider, select the **CloudWatch** monitoring level. Leave as **Basic** for the default EC2 monitoring.
    5.  In **Public IP Address**, select the public IP address that suits your requirements.

10. Click the **Customize** tab to set additional instance options.
    1.  Under **Credentials**, enter a **Root Password** for the `root`{: .literal} user access to the instance.
    2.  Enter a **IP Address Information** for the instance. Leave as **DHCP** for automatic IP assignment from the provider.
    3.  Enter any **DNS** information for the instance if necessary.
    4.  Select a **Customize Template** for additional instance configuration. Select from the Cloudinit scripts stored on your appliance.

11. Click the **Schedule** tab to set the provisioning and retirement date and time.
    1.  In **Schedule Info**, choose whether the provisioning begins upon approval, or at a specific time. If you select **Schedule**, you will be prompted to enter a date and time.
    2.  In **Lifespan**, select whether to power on the instances after they are created, and whether to set a retirement date. If you select a retirement period, you will be prompted for when to receive a retirement warning.

12. Click **Submit**.

Result:

The provisioning request is sent for approval. For the provisioning to begin, a user with the admin, approver, or super admin account role must approve the request. The admin and super admin roles can also edit, delete, and deny the requests. You will be able to see all provisioning requests where you are either the requestor or the approver.


#### Approving a Provisioning Request

After a user creates provisioning request, administrators have the ability to approve the request and allow ManageIQ to complete virtual machine or instance creation.

**Procedure 6.6. To approve a provisioning request**

1.  Navigate to **Services** → **Requests**.
2.  Click on the request you want to approve.
3.  Type in a **Reason** for the approval.
4.  Click ![](doc/getting-started/1852.png) **(Approve this request)**.

Result:

The provision request is sent for completion.
