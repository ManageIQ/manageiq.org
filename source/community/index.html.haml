      ## Governance and licensing

      The ManageIQ project is a meritocracy. We practice open and transparent
      planning and development. As a project participant, you get a say in the
      features we will prioritize in future versions, you can see feature
      planning and code contributions [as they
      happen](http://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq), and you can propose your
      own changes via pull requests.

      We want the ManageIQ community to be a nice place to hang out and we
      expect community members to treat each other with courtesy and respect.
      Please familiarize yourself with our
      [community guidelines](community_guidelines).

      All code contributed to the core of the project is contributed under a
      dual license: GPL v2 and Apache License v2. To understand why, and for
      more information on licensing and governance of ManageIQ, please read
      the [ManageIQ Licensing FAQ](licensing_faq).
