## Reporting security issues

We place a very high value on protecting our users' security and data.
Because of the sensitive nature of security issues and issues which could
expose confidential user data, we have put in place a special procedure for
dealing with them.

To notify us of a security issue, please send an email to
[security@manageiq.org](mailto:security@manageiq.org), encrypted with the
following GPG public key:

**650d5882: Red Hat, Inc. (Security Response Team) <secalert@redhat.com>**

This key is used for communicating securely with the Red Hat Security
Response Team and for signing the security advisories posted to mailing lists.

Issues reported here will be recorded and resolved in Red Hat Bugzilla, and
reported publicly once a fix is available to affected users (ManageIQ and any
commercial products  built on top of it).
