## Install ManageIQ from source

To get started developing ManageIQ, or to deploy on an OS other than CentOS
or Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), there are a few steps to get started.

A lot of this has been automated in the [ManageIQ kickstart
file](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq-appliance-build/blob/master/kickstarts/base.ks.erb).
Details on installing an image using a quickstart file are available from
[the Kickstart page on Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart).

{:.steps}
1.  For RHEL, make sure you have `rhel-6-server-rpms` channel enabled.

    ```
    rhn-channel --add --channel=rhel-6-server-rpms --user=(your RHN login) --password=(password)
    ```

2.  As root, add the miqbuilder user

    ```bash
    useradd miqbuilder
    passwd miqbuilder
    ```

3.  (Optional) For both RHEL and CentOS, download and install the epel (Extra Packages
    for Enterprise Linux) package

    ```bash
    yum -y install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6Server/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  `miqbuilder` should be set to use `sudo`. Add the following line to
    /etc/sudoers with the command `visudo`:

    ```bash
    miqbuilder ALL=(ALL) ALL
    ```

5.  ManageIQ prerequisites are git, libxml2 and libxslt (including headers),
    postgresql, and memcached. sudo should be upgraded to the latest version.
    On RHEL and CentOS, install these packages:

    ```bash
    yum -y install git libxml2-devel libxslt libxslt-devel sudo
    yum -y install postgresql-server postgresql-devel memcached ruby-devel gcc-c++
    ```

6.  Start memcached

    ````
    service memcached start
    chkconfig memcached on
    ````

7. Configure Postgres

   1. Initialize the database:

      ```bash
      systemctl postgresql initdb
      ````

   2. Edit `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`, comment out everything and add
      the following line:

      ````bash
      local all all trust
      ````

   3. Edit `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf` and add
      `listen_addresses='*'`

   3. Start the database:

      ```bash
      service postgresql start
      ````

   4. Log in as postgres, and generate test, production and development
      databases and the root user.  Then assign the development database
      `vmdb_development` to `root`

      ```bash
      su - postgres
      for i in test production development;do createdb vmdb_$i;done
      psql -c "create role root login password 'smartvm'"
      psql -c "alter database vmdb_development owner to root"
      ```

8.  As user miqbuilder, set up the ManageIQ Ruby development environment.

    ```bash
    su - miqbuilder
    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    rvm install 2.0.0
    gem install bundler -v ">=1.8.4"
    ```

    Note: You can install the development version of rvm by using:
    `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`

    See the [rvm website](http://rvm.io/rvm/install) for more information on installing rvm.

    Note: The bundler version needs to match the [version constraint specified in the lib/Gemfile](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/43eb6a63e220e0274068549708644edce78485f4/lib/Gemfile#L3)

9.  Clone the ManageIQ repo and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq
    cd manageiq
    bundle install
    ```

10. Ensure that ManageIQ is connecting to the right database. Edit the
    `config/database.yml` file.  Add the `root` user for the
    `vmdb_development` database.

    ```
    cp config/database.pg.yml config/database.yml
    bin/rake db:migrate
    bin/rake evm:start
    ```

You should now be able to access the ManageIQ console at **\<IP_ADDRESS\>:3000**. The default username and password is `username : admin` and `password : smartvm`

### Mac

* Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

  If you do not have Homebrew installed, go to the Homebrew website and install it.

* Install Packages

  ```bash
  brew install git
  brew install memcached
  brew install postgresql
  ```

* Configure memcached

  ```bash
  $ mkdir ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  $ cp /usr/local/Cellar/memcached/$version/homebrew.mxcl.memcached.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
  $ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.memcached.plist.
  $ /opt/local/bin/memcached -d -p 11211
  ```
  
* Configure PostgreSQL

  ```bash
  # Enable PostgreSQL on boot
  mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist

  psql -c "CREATE ROLE root SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'smartvm'"
  psql -c "alter database vmdb_development owner to root”
  
  env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg
  ```
 
 
## Setup Git and Github

* The most reliable authentication mechanism for git uses SSH keys.
  * [SSH Key Setup](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) Set up a SSH keypair for authentication.  Note: If you enter a passphrase, you will be prompted every time you authenticate with it.

* Github account setup [Account Settings](https://github.com/settings).
  * [Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile): Fill in your personal information, such as your name.
  * [Profile](https://github.com/settings/profile): Optionally set up an avatar at gravatar.com.  When you set up your gravatar, be sure to have an entry for the addresses you plan to use with git / Github.
  * [Emails](https://github.com/settings/emails): Enter your e-mail address and verify it, click the Verify button and follow the instructions.
  * [Notification Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications) / Notification Email / Custom Routing: Change the email address associated with ManageIQ if desired.
* Forking ManageIQ/manageiq:
  * Go to [ManageIQ/mangeiq](https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq)
  * Click the Fork button and choose "Fork to \<yourname\>"
* If you are a member of the ManageIQ organization:
  * Go to [the Members page](https://github.com/ManageIQ?tab=members).
    * Verify you are listed.
    * Optionally click Publicize Membership.

* Git configuration and default settings.

  ```zsh
  git config --global user.name "Joe Smith"
  git config --global user.email joe.smith@example.com
  git config --global --bool pull.rebase true
  git config --global push.default simple
  ```
  If you need to use git with other email addresses, you can set the local user.email from within the clone using:

  ```zsh
  git config user.name "Joe Smith"
  git config user.email joe.smith@example.com
  ```

## Install Ruby

* RVM: <http://rvm.io/>

  ```bash
  $ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable —ruby
  ```
  
* RUBY:

  ```bash  
  $ rvm install ruby-2.0.0
  $ rvm --default use ruby-2.0.0
  ```

## Clone the Code

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:JoeSmith/manageiq.git # Use "-o my_fork" if you don't want the remote to be named origin
cd manageiq
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ManageIQ/manageiq.git
git fetch upstream
```

You can add other remotes at any time to collaborate with others by running:

```zsh
git remote add other_user git@github.com:OtherUser/manageiq.git
git fetch upstream
```


## Get the Rails environment up and running

```zsh
gem install bundler -v ">=1.8.4"
bundle install
cp config/database.pg.yml config/database.yml
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
bin/rake evm:start
```

You should now be able to access the ManageIQ console at **\<IP_ADDRESS\>:3000**. The default username and password is `username : admin` and `password : smartvm`
