We're happy to announce the preliminary agenda for the upcoming ManageIQ Design Summit, a [2-day event on October 7 & 8 in Montvale, NJ](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/). Be sure to [RSVP soon](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/), as space is very limited. As mentioned in the title, it's a small intimate gathering of cloud experts, those interested in pushing the limits of ManageIQ and setting the roadmap for development. If you're a ManageIQ user who wants to learn how to make the most of its automation and orchestration capabilities, then there will be plenty for you, too:

- Tour the new RESTful APIs released in Anand
- Create reusable components for automation and orchestration of your hybrid cloud infrastructure
- Hack rooms for those who want to dive in

The proud sponsors of the event are [Red Hat](http://redhat.com/) and [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://boozallen.com/). I've been told to be on the lookout for a new open source cloud broker project from the Booz Allen engineers.

Look forward to [seeing you there](http://miqdevsummit14.eventbrite.com/)!
