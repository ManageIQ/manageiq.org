On behalf of the ManageIQ team, we're pleased to announce Release Candidate 1 for ManageIQ Fine!

Fine is the next milestone release for ManageIQ cloud and virtualization management platform. With each release, ManageIQ gets more robust and feature complete across providers. In this release, a lot of attention was given to Ansible. However, other providers, REST API, as well as performance also benefit in this release.

* Ansible Tower: Refresh job_template -> playbook connection.
* Middleware: Cross-linking Middleware server model with containers.
* Performance: Optimize number of transactions sent in refresh.
* Microsoft Infrastructure: Ensure remote shells generated by SCVMM are closed when finished.
* Control: Add policy checking for request_host_scan.
