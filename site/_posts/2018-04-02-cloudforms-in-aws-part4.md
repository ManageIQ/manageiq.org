In this post of our series, we will demonstrate what we did in the previous sections in which we configured AWS and CloudForms, to run a SmartStaty analysis to automatically resolve a vulnerability in Java

In the video, I will:

* Perform a SmartState Analysis (SSA) in my instance
* Review the SSA process
* Add a compliance policy to the instance
* Execute the policy
* Verify the remediation action
* Validate the auto-remediation
