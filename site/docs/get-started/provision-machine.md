title: Provision Your First Instance
---

Let’s generate a new instance through ManageIQ, the hard way. Don't worry, And afterwards
we will rehearse a method that is easier for customers.

### Generate a new instance

Go to ***Compute → Cloud → Instances***, and select your Google provider in
the tree.

You will see all the instances in the provider independently of the
availability zone they belong to.

If you have more than a cloud provider ***all your instances from all your providers***
will be available at the same time and you will be able to interact with them.

Select ***Lifecycle → Provision Instances*** from the bar on the top.

about this in the documentation.

number of instances, its name and description.
