In this chapter we will use ManageIQ with the google [Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

Many other platforms are available including Amazon Web Server, VMware
vSphere and OpenStack.

Capabilities between providers can be different
and evolve with time, so don’t forget to check the [support options
document](*The link to the support options document*)

### Create a Google Cloud Platform account (if needed)

Create the Google Cloud Platform free trial account if you don’t have
one already. You will need an existing Google account that you will use
to create a new GCP project and billing account.

[Google Cloud Platform gree trial](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial)

Once you have your billing account created and you have started your
trial, create a VM to make sure that everything is working.

Press ***Get started*** in the Google Cloud Platform console to follow a
tutorial on the platform.

1.  Enable billing in the account
2.  Create a project, Google Compute Engine will take some minutes to
    start
3.  Create an instance or follow the tutorial. For instance, a CentOS 7
    VM with 10 GB hard drive

### Refresh the provider in ManageIQ

1.  Providers are refreshed every few minutes and when events happen in
    the system. If you don’t see all the data the first time you will
    need to go to the Provider and then to *Configuration → Refresh
    Relationships and Power States*
2.  Sometimes the credentials for the Cloud need to be refreshed, go to
    the Provider and then press *Authentication → Re-check
    Authentication Status* to trigger a refreshment.
