## [Mastering Automation in ManageIQ]({{ site.book_path }})

Learn how to work with the Automate feature of ManageIQ, the powerful open-source cloud management platform that lets you administer your virtual infrastructure, including hybrid public and private clouds. This practical hands-on introduction shows you how to increase your operational efficiency by automating day-to-day tasks that now require manual input.

Throughout the [book]({{ site.book_path }}), author [Peter McGowan](https://github.com/pemcg/) provides a combination of theoretical information and practical coding examples to help you learn the Automate object model. With this ManageIQ feature, you can create auto-scalable cloud applications, eliminate manual decisions and operations when provisioning virtual machines and cloud instances, and manage your complete virtual machine lifecycle.
